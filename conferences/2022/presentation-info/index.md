# Presentation Expectations

_Last updated 10 September 2022_

## Overview

TDWG 2022 will be our first in-person conference since the COVID-19 pandemic and will feature a significant proportion of remote (virtual) participants from all over the world. The hours of the conference will correspond to those of the hosts in Sofia, Bulgaria (9 AM–6 PM [UTC+3 EEST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20221017T060000&p1=238)) from 17–21 October at the [Grand Hotel Millennium Sofia](https://grandhotelmillenniumsofia.bg/) (see [360˚ tour](https://360tour.ghms.bg/) of the Conference Center 4th floor). 

- All presenters and session organizers must be [registered](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2022/#registration) for the conference.
- There will be parallel sessions each day (except Wednesday), with sessions ranging from 60 to 120 minutes with 30 minute breaks between sessions.
- In-person speakers should upload their slides at least 24 h prior to the start of their session
- Speakers should arrive at least 20 minutes ahead of a session start for a technical check. 
- Remote speakers may decide to present live, but they must pre-record their presentations so that a back-up is in place in case of technical failure.
- **Pre-recorded presentations should be uploaded by 26 September.**

### Language

While the language of the conference is English, we are experimenting this year with allowing speakers to present in a language other than English IF the presentation is pre-recorded and includes English subtitles and slide content. **NEW: please email [conf-organizers@tdwg.org](mailto:conf-organizers@tdwg.org) if you intend to do this.**

### Contacts

**[Session co-organizers](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2022/session-list/)** if you have questions about the organization of your session or your contribution to it.

**[conf-organizers@tdwg.org](mailto:conf-organizers@tdwg.org)** if you need to change your registration type or require special accommodations at the conference, which were not already listed when you registered.

[Instructions for Virtual Posters and Poster Presenters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YUCvkJNfbXyjR3Zc8O4i2cU0PpOBYyxuQbxpcnLOSOs/edit?usp=sharing)

Note that the above documents will not include links for uploading presentations. These will be provided in a separate email via MailChimp to those requiring the links.

## Contributed Oral Presentations

Contributed Oral Presentations are **10 minutes to present + 3 min. for questions + 2 min. to change presenters (total 15 min/presentation)**. There will be a mixture of live (streamed and recorded) in-person presentations as well as pre-recorded presentations by those attending virtually. If possible, virtual presenters will be present in Zoom to answer questions during the conference and/or on the TDWG2022 Slack Workspace designed for this purpose. Details to opt-in to Zoom and the TDWG2022 Slack will be handled in a separate communication to registrants.

Each presentation features an abstract published in Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS), as [TDWG Proceedings 2022](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/384/).

## Symposia

Symposia generally use the same 15 minute format as Contributed Oral presentations (10 min talks + 3 min for questions + 2 min transition to next speaker). Symposia may include time set aside for an introduction and a discussion. As with Contributed Oral presentations, the hybrid conference will feature live streamed in-person talks and pre-recorded talks by virtual participants. Virtual participants should make every effort to be a part of the live symposium to answer questions and participate in any discussion, however all presenters will have the opportunity to answer questions or join a discussion in the TDWG2022 Slack workspace. Details will be emailed to registrants separately allowing registrants to opt-in to this workspace.

Each presentation features a published abstract found [here](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/384/). The list of symposium organizers and descriptions are [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2022/session-list/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2022/session-list/).

## Workshop & Discussion

The workshop (WKSH11) and discussion (PD13, formerly panel discussion) will include introductions setting the stage for the participants. These will be recorded, but any breakout parts of the working sessions may not. While we encourage the submission of at least one abstract to represent each session, and require abstracts for any talks featured in the program, organizers may arrange to submit an abstract summarizing outcomes (post-conference), or to submit a longer, post-conference article (cost of longer article not included as part of registration) to the [TDWG 2022 Proceedings](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/384/).

## Demos & Lightning Talks (and other interactive genre)

Abstracts are expected for all talks listed in the program. The time allotted to presenters for these genres is up to the organizers of the sessions.  Please contact the [session organizer](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2022/session-list/) if you are presenting in one of these sessions (LT07; LTD14; INT19).

## Virtual Posters

Each poster features a published abstract. While there will be a time reserved on Thursday afternoon for poster presenters to interact with other attendees, posters will be available for viewing, comments, and questions throughout the conference and should be uploaded to the proper folder (link will be emailed separately; see also [Instructions for Poster Presenters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YUCvkJNfbXyjR3Zc8O4i2cU0PpOBYyxuQbxpcnLOSOs/edit?usp=sharing)) by **7 October**.

Posters should be uploaded as PDF files. Presenters may also provide a short video (<3 min) about their posters. See also [Instructions for Posters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YUCvkJNfbXyjR3Zc8O4i2cU0PpOBYyxuQbxpcnLOSOs/edit?usp=sharing).

**Note:** There is no space or provisions for physical posters at the venue.

## Featured plenary or keynote speakers

Four keynote speakers will present talks in plenary during the conference. See [list of speakers](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2022/keynotes/).  Their abstracts are published [here](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/406/).
