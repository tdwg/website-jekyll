We are pleased to announce the call for abstracts for [TDWG 2022](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2022/), the hybrid conference of [Biodiversity Information Standards](https://tdwg.org/) (TDWG), which will be held 17â€“21 October 2022 in Sofia, Bulgaria. Abstracts will be submitted to and published in [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards](https://biss.pensoft.net/) (BISS). **The deadline for abstract submission is 1 July 2022.** Abstracts will be peer reviewed and final approval for publication requires payment of any registration fees by the presenter. [Registration is now open](https://events.pensoft.net/events/tdwg-2022-hybrid-conference). Content may be presented either in-person, virtually, or pre-recorded for TDWG 2022. Sessions will be recorded and made available initially only to registered attendees.
