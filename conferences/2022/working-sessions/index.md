# TDWG November 2022, Working Sessions 

TDWG will host working sessions of the Interest and Task Groups (IG/TG) during the week of 7-10 November. These sessions will be hosted in Zoom by TDWG and be free but require registration.


Working sessions will include introductions, overviews of IG/TG use cases, solutions, collaboration resources, and current work practices. The sessions will be interactive, with the participants being able to see each other and raise hands to interact with the conveners, speakers and other participants. 


Below you can find the list of sessions of the respective Interest Groups and Task Groups, and Functional Subcomittees.


# Schedule
The calendar below will display the schedule of sessions. Begin by using the controls in the upper left (below the title) to navigate the week of 6 November. Note that you need to scroll through the hours of the day (up and down) to see all sessions.  The displayed time zone of this calendar is UTC (00:00). You can view your local time for an event by clicking on the event and in the pop-up, clicking either "more details" or "copy to my calendar."  Alternatively, you can import the entire schedule of sessions by importing this [ics file](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/7439a042f07a82eea86e36ba52e8eac38e30a09f9535b2c477a6066f2024888f%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics), or clicking the "+Google Calendar" in the lower right. 

In addition, the sessions are listed below in chronological order, and each session has a link that will show the time in your local time zone. Please note, **the time for the MIDS session has been updated.** \[-Ed@2022-11-04T18:30UTC]

Time zone differences across our global community make it inevitable that some sessions of interest will occur outside normal working hours, or during the middle of the night, for some who would like to particpate.  Each session will be recorded and made available for later viewing. Session organizers have been encouraged to use shared notes to enable asynchronous participation. Links to videos and notes will be added to the descriptions below after the live session. 

# Registration and how to support the conference
[Registration is available through Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYrf-2pqj8jH9PST-k6ZmZWTPecwjSejmgf). Registration is required to participate in the online event, but it is free. A single registration will allow you to attend any of the sessions. When you register, please answer "Yes" for any meetings you will attend. This is not binding, but will give the meeting organizers an idea of how many to expect. (You do not need to answer "No" for meetings you are not planning to attend.)

The services required to run an online conference, however, are not free. We encourage all participants to [become TDWG members](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/) either as individuals or through their institution.

**About the group:** The current version of the standard was published more than 20 year ago. The previous edition was limited to the terrestrial domain and restricted to plants. The current developments, aiming to cover the marine domain and extend to all living organisms, may attract an ever more extended community of uses.

**Session Type:** Interest/Task Group meeting

**Organizer:** [Elspeth Haston](mailto:ehaston@rbge.org.uk), Royal Botanical Gardens Edinburgh (RBGE), Edinburgh, UK

**About the group:** Inspired by the idea of 'minimum information standards' adopted in other areas of biology we name this proposed TDWG standard as 'Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen' (MIDS). This harmonizing framework includes making the data publicly available because pen access policies in countries around the world require that digital data should be findable and accessible, even at the lowest level of available digitized information.
