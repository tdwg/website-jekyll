<!-- Translations: ES, FR, JP -->

The Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) annual conference in 2022 will be a hybrid meeting, hosted in Sofia, Bulgaria.

**Stronger together - in person or online!  #tdwg2022**

Although pandemic restrictions appear to be waning in many countries, we expect that many organizations will still be limiting professional travel in the fall of 2022. Consequently, TDWG 2022 will be a hybrid conference; in-person for those who can travel, and virtual for those who cannot. The conference will accommodate symposia, workshops, contributed oral and poster presentations, demos, and discussions, as well as keynotes and social events. Session timing will be anchored to the working hours of Sofia, Bulgaria, where the in-person conference will be held. (UTC+3; EEST during the conference.) Sessions will be streamed live via Zoom, as well as recorded and posted for people participating remotely (registration required). 

## Conference notifications

Important conference notifications are being sent from Conference Organizers or TDWG Secretariat to **registrants** via MailChimp. These include 

- personalized links to join session Zoom tracks (required for virtual participation); _N.B. if you do not already have a Zoom account, you will need to  register for a free account before registering for conference Zoom tracks (track = room at conference)._
- an invitation to join the dedicated TDWG2022 Slack workspace (for synchronous, asynchronous, in-person and virtual participant networking and interactions). See introduction to [using TDWG 2022 Slack](https://tinyurl.com/using-TDWG2022-slack).
- links and instructions for uploading slides, pre-recorded video, and posters for the conference (see deadlines!)

These links should not be shared. Questions? Contact [conf-organizers@tdwg.org](mailto:conf-organizers@tdwg.org).

## Deadlines

- **If you are presenting in person** your slides must be uploaded no later than the end of sessions on the day prior to your presentation to allow the transfer by the technical folk at VIBE to the conference laptops.
- **If presenting virtually** your slides also must be uploaded by the end of day _in Sofia_ prior to your presentation. Please join the Zoom room 20 minutes prior to your session to test your access to the conference. 
- **If you will rely on your recorded presentation,** please notify your session organizer or moderator (see [program](https://tinyurl.com/TDWG2022-program)) and let them know if you will be available for questions after the recording.

Uploading instructions were distributed on 22 September via MailChimp. If you cannot find this email, see the pinned post in TDWG 2022 Slack channel #help-tdwg2022.

The deadline with no penalty (minus credit card fees) to switch from on-line to virtual attendance was 17 August.

<!--- <b><a href="https://events.pensoft.net/events/tdwg-2022-hybrid-conference" target="_blank" class="btn btn-secondary">Register for TDWG 2022</a></b> --->

Registration costs differ for in-person or virtual participation. As in past years, registration fees include a discount structure, and help to defray the cost of abstract publication. Special discounts are in place for students, post-docs or early career researchers, and participants from [low/low-middle income nations](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups). You can even donate funds to support registration of those in need.  

**All session organizers and _presenters_ at TDWG 2022 must be registered.** If you are listed as a presenter on an [abstract](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/384/) for the conference, you must be registered before your abstract will be published. Please do this as soon as possible so that we can create the program.  If you are unsure whether you will attend in person or virtually, there is no penalty for registering for virtual participation and later upgrading to in-person status. There is a penalty (after 17 August) for downgrading registration (see [Terms & Conditions on registration link](https://events.pensoft.net/events/tdwg-2022-hybrid-conference)).

If the cost of registration is a barrier to your participation in this conference, please contact [conf-organizers@tdwg.org](mailto:conf-organizers@tdwg.org) and briefly state why this is a barrier.

### Virtual registration includes

- **Zoom links** to live streamed in-person sessions - you must register _in advance_ in Zoom for these links. Emails via MailChimp were sent with instructions on 5 October, with a reminder on 10 October to all registrants. A final reminder (in addition to personally sent ones) was sent 15 October. 
- **Links to content on demand** for sessions you may have missed
