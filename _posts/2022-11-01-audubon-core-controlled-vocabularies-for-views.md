## Audubon Core: open comment period for three term-change proposals begins 15 January.

The Audubon Core Maintenance Group is opening a public comment period for three term-change proposals starting on 15 January 2022. The comment period will continue **until 15 February,** or until consensus is reached on the proposal and there are no dissenting comments for 30 days. To view and comment on the proposals, visit [https://github.com/tdwg/ac/milestone/5](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/milestone/5) and comment on the respective issues.  IMPORTANT NOTE: one of the proposals ([https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/220](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/220)) has technical implications that could set a precedent beyond Audubon Core (proposes using the W3C standard, "Semantic Annotation of Web Services Description Language and XML Schema," to document relationships between terms in different schemas). Another ([https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/195](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/195)) has potential implications for stability of existing implementations that use ac:subjectPart and ac:subjectOrientation. If these implications affect you, we strongly urge you to share your thoughts prior to the close of comment period.
